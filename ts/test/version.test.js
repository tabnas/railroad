// This is the CI check for version drift. It exists because the constant HAS
// drifted: @tabnas/json exported Version = '1.0.0' for several releases while
// the package shipped 0.4.x, and jsonic-cli shipped 0.4.1 and 0.4.2 with its
// const stuck at 0.4.0. Nothing rewrote either, and both were invisible until
// someone read the file. A release that bumps package.json and forgets the
// constant now fails here.
